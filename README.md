Retail & Customer Sales Data Cleaning and EDA Project

This project focuses on data cleaning (ETL)and exploratory data analysis (EDA)for two business-critical datasets:

- 🛍️ Retail Transaction Data
- 👥 Customer Sales Data

The goal is to simulate real-world data workflows for a business that wants to clean, process, and extract insights from messy and raw CSV or SQL-based data using **SQL** and **Python (pandas)**.
